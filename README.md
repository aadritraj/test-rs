# test-rs
This repository consists of every little program I've made to learn Rust.
Everything of value is in the ``projects`` directory.

Change into the directory aligning with the chapter number in the Rust Book.
Run ``cargo run x`` where x is the program you want to run, all of which can be found in the chapter directory.

## Example Usage
This shows you how to run the guessing game progam in Chapter 2.

Assuming you are in the Root Directory:
```pwsh
> cd programs/02
> cargo run guess
```
